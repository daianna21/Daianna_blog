# Introduction

MAGMA¬†stands for¬†**Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation**¬†and is a computational tool for the analysis of the joint effect of multiple genetic markers on a phenotype based on Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data. MAGMA constitutes a flexible and generalizable approach to assess the¬†**association**¬†of¬†[**individual genes**]{.underline}¬†or¬†[**gene-sets**]{.underline}¬†with a¬†**phenotype**¬†based on the associations that the¬†[**SNPs**]{.underline}¬†of the genes have with the same phenotype.

This is a commonly used method that you'll likely find implemented while reading about GWASes or that you'll need to run if working with genetic variant associations and gene-set enrichment analysis, so let's see how it works.

# How does it work?

MAGMA allows to first perform a gene analysis and subsequently a gene-set analysis based on gene-level results. Note, however, that the gene-set analysis comes as a separate layer and it is an additional optional step, though it is frequently performed and quite useful.

## **Gene analysis**

Genetic markers are aggregated to the level of whole individual genes and those in a given gene are jointly tested for their association with the phenotype, defining in such way the association of the gene itself. This definitely allows to detect significant associations of multiple small-effect markers in a gene that individually would be missed, i.e., associations that depend on multiple markers. This also reduces the number of required tests and makes the results more interpretable by summarizing at the gene level.

Two alternatives for gene analysis are offered by MAGMA:

### [**Multiple linear PC regression model**]{style="color:#FF7256"}

If the input data is **raw genotype data**, MAGMA fits a multiple linear PC regression model to the individuals' phenotypes. Here, for one gene $g$ at a time, the SNP matrix that contains the information of the SNPs for that gene across all the $N$ individuals studied, is projected onto its Principal Components (PCs). These PCs capture genotypic differences between individuals for the given gene and the first $K$ most explanatory ones (comprising 99.9% of the variance) are used as predictors of the phenotype ($Y$) in the linear model.

![](images/MAGMA_PC_model.png){fig-align="center" width="650"}

Phenotype is modeled as:

$$
Y = \alpha_{0g}+X^*_{g}\alpha_g+W\beta_g+\epsilon_g
$$

$$
{\begin{bmatrix}Y_1 \\ ... \\ Y_{N-1} \\ Y_N\end{bmatrix}} = {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{0g} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{0g} \\ \alpha_{0g}\end{bmatrix}} + \stackrel{PC1 \ \  \ \  \ \ PC2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ PC_K} {\begin{bmatrix}  x_{11} \ \ x_{12} \ \ ... \ \ x_{1K}  \\  ... \\ x_{(N-1)1} \ \ x_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{(N-1)K} \\  x_{N1} \ \ x_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{NK} \end{bmatrix}} {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{g1} \\  \alpha_{g2} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{gK}\end{bmatrix}} + \stackrel{Cov1 \ \  \ \  \ \ Cov2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ CovL}{\begin{bmatrix}  w_{11} \ \ w_{12} \ \ ... \ \ w_{1L}  \\  ... \\ w_{(N-1)1} \ \ w_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{(N-1)L} \\  w_{N1} \ \ w_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{NL} \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{g1} \\  \beta_{g2} \\ ... \\ \beta_{gL}\end{bmatrix}} +
{\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{g1} \\ ... \\ \epsilon_{g(N-1)} \\  \epsilon_{gN}\end{bmatrix}}
$$

With $X_{g}^*$ the matrix of the first $K$ PCs for gene $g$ and $W$ a matrix of additional covariates for the individuals that can be included in the model. $\alpha_g$'s and $\beta_g$'s are the coefficients of the PCs and covariates for the gene $g$, respectively. $\epsilon_g$ is the vector of residuals and $\alpha_{0g}$ the intercept. The $\alpha_g$'s represent the effect of the genotype for gene $g$ on the phenotype (the **genetic effect**).

Then an F-test is used to assess if genotypes for gene $g$ have an effect on the phenotype under the null hypothesis that the genetic effect of $g$ on the phenotype is 0 across all PCs ($H_0:\alpha_g=\overrightarrow 0$). This leads to a *p*-value for the association of gene $g$ with the phenotype $Y$ based on its genetic markers.

‚úîÔ∏è The advantage of using PCs instead of variables for individual SNPs is that 1) the number of variables included in the linear model is reduced and 2) they allow to account for redundancy and collinearity between SNPs. Also this model offers flexibility to accommodate additional covariates to model the phenotype.

### [**SNP-wise gene analysis**]{style="color:#7AC5CD"}

If no raw genotype data is available, MAGMA also accepts [**SNP *p*-values**]{.underline} from a GWAS as input. In this case SNP *p*-values for a gene are first transformed into [**Z or** $\chi^2$**statistics**]{.underline} and then combined into a [**gene test-statistic**]{.underline} by the [**mean SNP statistic**]{style="background-color: #F0FFF0"} or [**top SNP statistic**]{style="background-color:#FFF0F5"} method. This gene test-statistic is then used to compute the [**gene *p*-value**]{.underline}, either by an approximation of the sampling distribution (mean SNP statistic method) or by phenotype permutation (mean and top SNP statistic methods).

This SNP-wise MAGMA analysis based on SNP summary statisitcs requires a **reference dataset** with similar ancestry as the data from which SNPs *p*-values were computed. This is needed to account for LD between SNPs. If an approximation of the sampling distribution is used to compute the gene *p*-value, this reference is required to obtain the SNP statistic correlation matrix $R$. If phenotype permutation is chosen, these reference data are necessary to generate the gene test-statistics empirical sampling distribution.

[**\***]{style="color:#EE00EE"}Gene test-statistics can be constructed from the SNP statistics applying one of two implemented methods in MAGMA:

-   [**Mean SNP statistic**]{style="background-color: #F0FFF0"}:

    -   **Mean Z gene test-statistic**: SNP *p*-values of a gene are transformed to Z-statistics and the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of such Z-stats is used as the test-statistic of the gene: $T=\sum_i^G w_iz_i$, with $G$ the total number of SNPs of the gene and $z_i$ and $w_i$ the Z-statistic and weight for SNP $i$, respectively. These gene test-stats follow a normal distribution.

    -   **Mean** $\chi^2$ **gene test-statistic**: the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of the $-2log$ of the SNP *p*-values (that are $\sim\chi^2_{(2)}$) is used as gene test-statistic: $T=-2\sum_i^G w_i\log(p_i)$, with $p_i$ the *p*-value of SNP $i$. These gene test-stats are assumed to be $\sim c\chi^2_{(f)}$, where $c$ and $f$ are constants of the distribution.

    [**\***]{style="color: #00CD00"}For both mean Z and mean $\chi^2$ gene test-statistics the *p*-value of the gene is obtained based on a known **approximation of the sampling distribution** of the gene test-stats. For such purposes, the reference dataset is needed to estimate the SNP statistic correlation matrix, from which the optional SNP weights ($w_i$) are computed to correct for dependency between SNPs. A phenotype permutation procedure can also be applied to compute empirical gene *p*-values (see further below).

-   [**Top SNP statistic(s)**]{style="background-color:#FFF0F5"}: the lowest SNP *p*-value among all SNPs in the gene (corresponding to the most associated SNP) or the sum of the $-log(p)$ for the top most associated SNPs is used as the gene test-statistic.

    [**\***]{style="color: #00CD00"}To compute the gene *p*-value a **phenotype permutation** procedure is the only option available. Here random phenotypes are assigned to the reference data and a top gene test-statistic is computed in each permutation. The empirical gene *p*-value is computed as the proportion of these permuted gene test-statistics that are higher than the observed one.

::: callout-note
Note that the SNP-wise gene analysis of MAGMA can also be run with raw genotype data, in which case SNP *p*-values are computed internally and the raw genotype data takes place of the reference data.

## Gene-set analysis

Gene-set analysis operates in the same way for gene analysis results based on the PC linear regression

By aggregating genes in groups of genes that share cellular or functional properties and evaluating their association with a phenotype, we can gain insights into the potential molecules, pathways, and tissues implicated in the phenotype's etiology.

Two gene-level regression models are implemented:

Genes of our particular interest are in turn aggregated into gene sets depending on their biological functions or other shared characteristics/involvements (such as being up/down DEGs). Analyzing gene sets evidently reduces the number of output tests but the gene analysis still has to be performed.
