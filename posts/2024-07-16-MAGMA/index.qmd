# Introduction

MAGMA¬†stands for¬†**Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation**¬†and is a computational tool for the analysis of the joint effect of multiple genetic markers on a phenotype based on Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data. MAGMA constitutes a flexible and generalizable approach to assess the¬†**association**¬†of¬†[**individual genes**]{.underline}¬†or¬†[**gene-sets**]{.underline}¬†with a¬†**phenotype**¬†based on the associations that the¬†[**SNPs**]{.underline}¬†of the genes have with the same phenotype.

This is a commonly used method that you'll likely find implemented while reading about GWASes or that you'll need to run if working with genetic variant associations and gene-set enrichment analysis, so let's see how it works.

# How does it work?

MAGMA allows to first perform a gene analysis and subsequently a gene-set analysis based on gene-level results. Note, however, that the gene-set analysis comes as a separate layer and it is an additional optional step, though it is frequently performed and quite useful.

## Gene analysis

Genetic markers are aggregated to the level of whole individual genes and those in a given gene are jointly tested for their association with the phenotype, defining in such way the association of the gene itself. This definitely allows to detect significant associations of multiple small-effect markers in a gene that individually would be missed, i.e., associations that depend on multiple markers. This also reduces the number of required tests and makes the results more interpretable by summarizing at the gene level.

Two alternatives for gene analysis are offered by MAGMA:

### [**Multiple linear PC regression model**]{style="color:#FF7256"}

If the input data is **raw genotype data**, MAGMA fits a multiple linear PC regression model to the individuals' phenotypes. Here, for one gene $g$ at a time, the SNP matrix that contains the information of the SNPs for that gene across all the $N$ individuals studied, is projected onto its Principal Components (PCs). These PCs capture genotypic differences between individuals for the given gene and the first $K$ most explanatory ones (comprising 99.9% of the variance) are used as predictors of the phenotype ($Y$) in the linear model.

Phenotype is modeled as:

$$
Y = \alpha_{0g}+X^*_{g}\alpha_g+W\beta_g+\epsilon_g
$$

$$
{\begin{bmatrix}Y_1 \\ ... \\ Y_{N-1} \\ Y_N\end{bmatrix}} = {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{0g} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{0g} \\ \alpha_{0g}\end{bmatrix}} + \stackrel{PC1 \ \  \ \  \ \ PC2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ PC_K} {\begin{bmatrix}  x_{11} \ \ x_{12} \ \ ... \ \ x_{1K}  \\  ... \\ x_{(N-1)1} \ \ x_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{(N-1)K} \\  x_{N1} \ \ x_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ x_{NK} \end{bmatrix}} {\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{g1} \\  \alpha_{g2} \\ ... \\ \alpha_{gK}\end{bmatrix}} + \stackrel{Cov1 \ \  \ \  \ \ Cov2 \ \  \ \  \ \ ...  \ \ \ \ \ \ CovL}{\begin{bmatrix}  w_{11} \ \ w_{12} \ \ ... \ \ w_{1L}  \\  ... \\ w_{(N-1)1} \ \ w_{(N-1)2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{(N-1)L} \\  w_{N1} \ \ w_{N2} \ \ ... \ \ w_{NL} \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{g1} \\  \beta_{g2} \\ ... \\ \beta_{gL}\end{bmatrix}} +
{\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{g1} \\ ... \\ \epsilon_{g(N-1)} \\  \epsilon_{gN}\end{bmatrix}}
$$

With $X_{g}^*$ the matrix of the first $K$ PCs for gene $g$ and $W$ a matrix of additional covariates for the individuals that can be included in the model. $\alpha_g$'s and $\beta_g$'s are the coefficients of the PCs and covariates for the gene $g$, respectively. $\epsilon_g$ is the vector of residuals and $\alpha_{0g}$ the intercept. The $\alpha_g$'s represent the effect of the genotype for gene $g$ on the phenotype (the **genetic effect**).

Then an F-test is used to assess if genotypes for gene $g$ have an effect on the phenotype under the null hypothesis that the genetic effect of $g$ on the phenotype is 0 across all PCs ($H_0:\alpha_g=\overrightarrow 0$). This leads to a *p*-value for the association of gene $g$ with the phenotype $Y$ based on its genetic markers.

‚úîÔ∏è The advantage of using PCs instead of variables for individual SNPs is that 1) the number of variables included in the linear model is reduced and 2) they allow to account for redundancy and collinearity between SNPs. Also this model offers flexibility to accommodate additional covariates to model the phenotype.

### [**SNP-wise gene analysis**]{style="color:#7AC5CD"}

If no raw genotype data is available, MAGMA also accepts [**SNP *p*-values**]{.underline} from a GWAS as input. In this case, such SNP *p*-values are first transformed into [**Z or** $\chi^2$ **statistics**]{.underline} and aggregated at the gene level[\*]{style="color:#FF00FF"} to obtain [**one test-statistic per gene**]{.underline} which is then used to compute the [**gene *p*-value**]{.underline}, either by an approximation of the sampling distribution ([**mean SNP statistic**]{style="background-color: #F0FFF0"} method) or by phenotype permutation ([**top SNP statistic**]{style="background-color:#FFF0F5"} method).

## Gene-set analysis

By aggregating genes in groups of genes that share cellular or functional properties and evaluating their association with a phenotype, we can gain insights into the potential molecules, pathways, and tissues implicated in the phenotype's etiology.

Two gene-level regression models are implemented:
