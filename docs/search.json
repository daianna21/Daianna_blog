    "text": "A little about me\n\nHey! Daianna here. I graduated from the undergraduate program of Genomic Sciences 🧬 at the National Autonomous University of Mexico 🇲🇽 LCG-UNAM in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico in 2024. Currently I work at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, U.K. analyzing single-cell data from iPSC-derived microglia to unveil the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative diseases.\nDuring the last few years I’ve been involved in multiple omics projects. At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) I analyzed transcriptomic data to explore brain develpment and function 🧠, and at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) I’ve studied genetic variability in genes influencing drug response and toxicity 💊. Along the way, with my undergrad courses and projects, analyzing and dealing with my own data, and attending courses, conferences, and meetings, I’ve learned about statistical analyses and bioinformatic tools and I wanted to share all this knowledge with the scientific community 👥, particularly with other students like me that may not have the same opportunities or academic background but also want to analyze datasets to answer biologically-relevant questions."

    "text": "Motivation for this website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing scientific research, collaborating with my classmates and peers, and assisting in bioinformatics courses I’ve noticed the existence of two common problems while analyzing data:\n\nIn these interconnected times, with praiseworthy collaborative efforts such as the Bioconductor project we can easily develop, share, and use other people’s code, data, methods, and even complete packages for our own analyses. That represents an incredible opportunity for all of us to leverage, contribute, and improve popular and new-emerging computational tools for the reproducible analysis of biological data, no doubts! However, for students and novice researchers, and people coming from areas other than biostatistics, computational biology, or bioinformatics, some analyses may represent obscure –if not completely unknown– territories. People developing these algorithms often assume they have a specialized audience and tend to trivialize underlying statistical concepts and methods when describing their computational functions and packages, not to mention the poor or even missing documentation and support some of the authors offer (with notable exceptions such as limma and variancePartition, among others). \nSecond, nowadays it is incredibly simple to run a complete pipeline with a single function. That’s efficient and increases productivity but it also has diluted the needed understanding behind their use. I have found many people, including myself, deludedly thinking we master an analysis only because we have run software programs without errors and have received outputs. We may dominate the practice but that doesn’t imply nor guarantee we understand the theory. \n\n\nIt seems to me we are a generation of trained students that know how to run an analysis and obtain results, but don’t understand the analyses themselves; in some occasions, not even the reasons why we execute them. But this is not limited to undergrad or master students: you would be surprised by the number of PhD students, postdocs, and researchers that relate to this!\n\n❗️❗️❗️ More alarming than the aforementioned I’d say, is not to be aware of why it is important to really understand the aims and foundations of the methods we implement. It is not until we do that, that we can make accurate and informed method selections based on the features of our data, detect unexpected and error-announcing results and interpret them correctly, map potential limitations of our analyses and draw rigorous meaningful conclusions from them."

    "text": "Imagine you have analyzed high-throughput omics data and have ended up with a list of candidate/interest genes (because everything is more interpretable at the gene level, isn’t?). These genes could be, for instance, differently expressed genes (DEGs), genes associated with a certain disease, genes affected by risk SNPs, markers for cell types, etc. Any list of experimentally-derived genes with biological or clinical relevance applies.\nNow, what comes after that? If you found a few genes, you can do a little of research about them and make sense of your results, but what if you got thousands of genes? That’s not an easy task anymore and becomes unscalable. Moreover, despite each individual found gene providing valuable information, we can reveal more definite insights by studying all genes at the same time.\nSo what’s to do? We need to start thinking of these genes as a unique set with its own properties, and ask questions such as what do these genes have in common? what makes them being involved or affected by the condition under study, and what does that imply for cell functionality?\nFunctional enrichment analysis based on the one-sided Fisher’s exact test aims to test whether our genes as a set are associated with certain cellular properties or functions by assessing if sets of known genes that share biological activities or attributes (functional gene sets), have a statistically significant large overlap with our genes, i.e., if such functional gene sets are, what we call over-represented (or enriched, which is the same), among our genes. Stay on this post to learn more about how this test operates and how to understand and apply it to analyze sets of genes."

    "section": "Gene analysis",
    "text": "Gene analysis\nGenetic markers are aggregated to the level of whole individual genes and those in a given gene are jointly tested for their association with the phenotype, defining in such way the association of the gene itself. This definitely allows to detect significant associations given by multiple small-effect markers in a gene that individually would be missed, i.e., associations that depend on multiple markers. This also reduces the number of required tests and makes the results more interpretable by summarizing at the gene level.\nTwo alternatives for gene analysis are offered by MAGMA:\n\nMultiple linear PC regression model\nIf the input data is raw genotype data, MAGMA fits a multiple linear PC regression model to the individuals’ phenotypes. Here, for one gene \\(g\\) at a time, the SNP matrix that contains the information of the SNPs for that gene across all the \\(N\\) individuals studied, is projected onto its Principal Components (PCs). These PCs capture genotypic differences between individuals for the given gene and the first \\(K\\) most explanatory ones (comprising 99.9% of the variance) are used as predictors of the phenotype (\\(Y\\)) in the linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype is modeled as:\n\\[\nY = \\alpha_{0g}+X^*_{g}\\alpha_g+W\\beta_g+\\epsilon_g\n\\]\n\\[\n{\\begin{bmatrix}Y_1 \\\\ ... \\\\ Y_{N-1} \\\\ Y_N\\end{bmatrix}} = {\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_{0g} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\alpha_{0g} \\\\ \\alpha_{0g}\\end{bmatrix}} + \\stackrel{PC1 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ PC2 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ ...  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ PC_K} {\\begin{bmatrix}  x_{11} \\ \\ x_{12} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{1K}  \\\\  ... \\\\ x_{(N-1)1} \\ \\ x_{(N-1)2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{(N-1)K} \\\\  x_{N1} \\ \\ x_{N2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ x_{NK} \\end{bmatrix}} {\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_{g1} \\\\  \\alpha_{g2} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\alpha_{gK}\\end{bmatrix}} +  \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\stackrel{Cov1 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ Cov2 \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ ...  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CovL}{\\begin{bmatrix}  w_{11} \\ \\ w_{12} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{1L}  \\\\  ... \\\\ w_{(N-1)1} \\ \\ w_{(N-1)2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{(N-1)L} \\\\  w_{N1} \\ \\ w_{N2} \\ \\ ... \\ \\ w_{NL} \\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_{g1} \\\\  \\beta_{g2} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\beta_{gL}\\end{bmatrix}} +\n{\\begin{bmatrix}\\epsilon_{g1} \\\\ ... \\\\ \\epsilon_{g(N-1)} \\\\  \\epsilon_{gN}\\end{bmatrix}}\n\\]\nWith \\(X_{g}^*\\) the matrix of the first \\(K\\) PCs for gene \\(g\\) and \\(W\\) a matrix of additional covariates for the individuals that can be included in the model. \\(\\alpha_g\\)’s and \\(\\beta_g\\)’s are the coefficients of the PCs and covariates for the gene \\(g\\), respectively. \\(\\epsilon_g\\) is the vector of residuals and \\(\\alpha_{0g}\\) the intercept. The \\(\\alpha_g\\)’s represent the effect of the genotype for gene \\(g\\) on the phenotype (the genetic effect).\nThen an F-test is used to assess if genotypes for gene \\(g\\) have an effect on the phenotype under the null hypothesis that the genetic effect of \\(g\\) on the phenotype is 0 across all PCs (\\(H_0:\\alpha_g=\\overrightarrow 0\\)). This leads to a p-value for the association of gene \\(g\\) with the phenotype \\(Y\\) based on its genetic markers.\n\n✔️ The advantage of using PCs instead of variables for individual SNPs is that 1) the number of variables included in the linear model is reduced and 2) they allow to account for redundancy and collinearity between SNPs. Also this model offers flexibility to accommodate additional covariates to model the phenotype.\n\n\n\nSNP-wise gene analysis\nIf no raw genotype data is available, MAGMA also accepts SNP p-values from a GWAS as input. In this case SNP p-values for a gene are first transformed into Z or\\(\\chi^2\\)statistics and then combined into a gene test-statistic by the mean SNP statistic or top SNP statistic method. This gene test-statistic is then used to compute the gene p-value, either by an approximation of the sampling distribution (mean SNP statistic method) or by phenotype permutation (mean and top SNP statistic methods).\nThis SNP-wise MAGMA analysis based on SNP summary statistics requires a reference dataset with similar ancestry as the data from which SNPs p-values were computed. This is needed to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. If an approximation of the sampling distribution is used to compute the gene p-value, this reference is required to obtain the SNP statistic correlation matrix \\(R\\). If phenotype permutation is chosen, these reference data are necessary to generate the gene test-statistics empirical sampling distribution.\n\nSummary: SNP p-values → SNP statistics →* gene test-statistic →* gene p-value → gene z-score (\\(z_g\\))\n\n*Gene test-statistics can be constructed from the SNP statistics applying one of the two implemented methods in MAGMA:\n\nMean SNP statistic:\n\nMean Z gene test-statistic: SNP p-values of a gene are transformed to Z-statistics and the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of such Z-stats is used as the test-statistic of the gene: \\(T=\\sum_i^G w_iz_i\\), with \\(G\\) the total number of SNPs in the gene and \\(z_i\\) and \\(w_i\\) the Z-statistic and weight for SNP \\(i\\), respectively. These gene test-stats follow a normal distribution.\nMean \\(\\chi^2\\) gene test-statistic: the mean (weighted or unweighted sum) of the \\(-2log\\) of the SNP p-values (that are \\(\\sim\\chi^2_{(2)}\\)) is used as gene test-statistic: \\(T=-2\\sum_i^G w_i\\log(p_i)\\), with \\(p_i\\) the p-value of SNP \\(i\\). These gene test-stats are assumed to be \\(\\sim c\\chi^2_{(f)}\\), where \\(c\\) and \\(f\\) are constants of the distribution.\n\n*For both mean Z and mean \\(\\chi^2\\) gene test-statistics the p-value of the gene is obtained based on a known approximation of the sampling distribution of the gene test-stats. For such purposes, the reference dataset is needed to estimate the SNP statistic correlation matrix, from which the optional SNP weights (\\(w_i\\)) are computed to correct for dependency between SNPs. A phenotype permutation procedure can also be applied to compute empirical gene p-values (see further below).\nTop SNP statistic(s): the lowest SNP p-value among all SNPs in the gene (corresponding to the most associated SNP) or the sum of the \\(-log(p)\\) for the top most associated SNPs is used as the gene test-statistic.\n*To compute the gene p-value a phenotype permutation procedure is the only option available. Here random phenotypes are assigned to the reference data and a top gene test-statistic is computed in each permutation. The empirical gene p-value is computed as the proportion of these permuted gene test-statistics that are higher than the observed one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe SNP-wise gene analysis of MAGMA can also be run with raw genotype data, in which case SNP p-values are computed internally and the raw genotype data takes place of the reference data.\n\n\nAfter running the gene analysis, either by PC regression or SNP-wise analysis, the resulting gene p-values are subsequently transformed to Z-values (\\(z_g\\)) to be introduced into the gene-set analysis. These Z-values are normally distributed and capture the association strength of the genes with the phenotype: the greater (higher positive) they are the stronger the gene association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that with both PC regression and SNP-wise models we are not really looking at the sign (+/-) of the association of the genetic markers of a gene with the phenotype, just exploring if there’s an association at all:\n\nIn the PC regression model, we only assess if all genetic effects of a gene (\\(\\alpha_g\\)’s) are zero or not, but not if the global gene effect is positive or negative.\nWith SNP-wise methods, since they are based on SNP p-values that don’t inform about the sign of the association, just how strong it is, the gene test-stats derived from them are also reflecting “sign-ignorant” associations. The gene p-value, however, is computed based on the right tail of the distribution of these gene test-stats (\\(T\\)’s) as they correspond to stronger (but not necessarily positive) associations."

    "text": "Gene-set analysis\nOnce having gene-level associations, we can now think of gene-set associations. Initially, we aggregate genes in groups of genes that share cellular or functional properties, such as involvements in certain biological processes, with particular molecular functions, cellular locations, cell-type specific expression or activity, or differential expression for a given condition. These define concrete processes or features we may be interested in relating with a GWAS phenotype. By doing this, we can gain insights into the potential molecules, pathways, and tissues implicated in a phenotype’s etiology.\nSince all that’s necessary from the gene analysis to run the gene-set analysis are the gene Z-values, gene-set analysis operates the same independently of the gene analysis method applied (PC regression or SNP-wise), as both result in gene p-values and respective \\(z_g\\)’s.\nTwo gene-level regression models are implemented to asses the association of gene-sets with the phenotype:\n\nSelf-contained analysis\nTests if the genes of a gene set \\(s\\) are jointly associated with the phenotype. This is assessed by an intercept-only linear regression \\(Z_s=\\beta_0\\overrightarrow1+\\epsilon_s\\), with \\(Z_s\\) the variable with the \\(z_g\\)’s of the genes in \\(s\\). With this simple model we evaluate the null \\(H_0:\\beta_0=0\\) against the alternative \\(H_A: \\beta_0&gt;0\\). This is equivalent to a one-sided single-sample t-test comparing the mean association of genes in \\(s\\) to 0. In other words, we are evaluating if the mean association strength of the genes in the set is greater than 0 (i.e., if it is a strong association, not to be confused with a positive effect of \\(s\\) on the phenotype).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive analysis\nTests whether the genes in the set \\(s\\) are more strongly associated with the phenotype than the rest of genes not in the set. Here the outcome variable \\(Z\\) of the model now includes the \\(z_g\\) of all genes. We define \\(S_s\\) as a binary predictor of \\(Z\\) that equals 1 if a gene is in \\(s\\) and 0 if not: \\[Z=\\beta_{0s}\\overrightarrow1+S_s\\beta_s+\\epsilon\\]\nHere \\(\\beta_s\\) reflects the difference in the association strength of the genes in \\(s\\) versus those not in \\(s\\). The p-value of the gene set results from testing on \\(\\beta_s\\): we test \\(H_0: \\beta_s=0\\) vs \\(H_A: \\beta_s&gt;0\\), which is equivalent to a one-sided two-sample t-test evaluating if the mean association strength of genes in \\(s\\) is greater than the mean association strength of genes not in \\(s\\). But again, this doesn’t mean genes in the set \\(s\\) have a positive association with the phenotype. This analysis is performed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✔️ Both self-contained and competitive gene-set analyses are implemented through more general gene-level regression models that can accommodate combinations of gene sets and gene properties such as gene expression levels and gene size to test for their effects and correct for potential confounding effects. This can be useful, for example, to test if variables such as differential expression between tissues (🧠 vs 🩸) or conditions (⚕️vs 💊) have an effect on the phenotype.\nFurther, analyzing gene sets evidently reduces the number of output tests, but note that one test per gene still has to be performed in the the previous gene analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDue to LD between SNPs neighboring genes are usually correlated. This obligate us to assume \\(\\epsilon \\sim MVN(\\overrightarrow0, \\sigma^2R)\\) in the gene-set analysis, where \\(R\\) is the gene-gene correlation matrix."

    "text": "Imagine you have analyzed high-throughput omics data and have ended up with a list of candidate/interest genes (because everything is more interpretable at the gene level, isn’t?). These genes could be, for instance, differently expressed genes (DEGs), genes associated with a certain disease, genes affected by risk SNPs, markers for cell types, etc. Any list of experimentally-derived genes with biological or clinical relevance applies.\nNow, what comes after that? If you found a few genes, you can do a little of research about them and make sense of your results, but what if you got thousands of genes? That’s not an easy task anymore and becomes unscalable. Moreover, despite each individual found gene providing valuable information, we can reveal more definite insights by studying all genes at the same time.\nSo what’s to do? We need to start thinking of these genes as a unique set with its own properties, and ask questions such as what do these genes have in common? what makes them being involved or affected by the condition under study, and what does that imply for cell functionality?\nFunctional enrichment analysis based on the one-sided Fisher’s exact test aims to test whether our genes as a set are associated with certain cellular properties or functions by assessing if sets of known genes that share biological activities or attributes (functional gene sets), have a statistically significant large overlap with our genes, i.e., if such functional gene sets are, what we call over-represented (or enriched, which is the same), among our genes. Stay on this post to learn more about how this test operates and how to understand and apply it to analyze sets of genes."

    "text": "2. Testing for gene-set enrichment\nThe Fisher’s exact test is used to determine the probability of observing the joint value \\(a_{11}\\) in our table or a more extreme value (for contingency tables with the same fixed marginal totals) under the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) that there’s no association between the categorical variables, i.e., that they are independent. These probabilities are referred to as p-values. Smaller probabilities offer strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which is translated into statistical evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)) of association between the two variables.\nThis is how it operates:\n\nGiven the fixed marginal totals, we first we compute all possible contingency tables by enumerating all possible joint values \\(a_{11}\\): in this case from 0 to 12, which are the min. and max. numbers of DEGs that can be in BP+, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n❗️ The top left cell (\\(a_{11}\\)) of each table always corresponds to the joint value positive for both variables under examination (DEGs and BP+ genes).\n\n\n\nThen we estimate the probability of having such joint values in each contingency table under the null hypothesis. To do that we need to calculate the number of ways of obtaining the joint values by randomness in the gene selection process. Only 3 values have to be estimated for that:\n\nThe ways of selecting \\(a_{11} + a_{12}\\) = 15 genes (corresponding to the number of DEGs) without replacement from the total genes in the gene universe: \\({a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{21} + a_{22}} \\choose a_{11} + a_{12}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ways of selecting \\(a_{11}\\) = 9 genes (number of BP+ DEGs) without replacement out of the \\(a_{11} + a_{21}\\) = 12 genes in the functional set (BP+ genes): \\({{a_{11} + a_{21}} \\choose a_{11}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ways of selecting \\(a_{12}\\) = 6 genes (number of BP- DEGs) without replacement out of the \\(a_{12}+a_{22}\\) = 20 genes not in the functional set (BP- genes): \\({a_{12}+a_{22}}\\choose{a_{12}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these 3 values we define the probability of each table arrangement:\n\\[\np=\\frac{{{a_{11}+a_{21}}\\choose a_{11}} \\times {{a_{12}+a_{22}}\\choose{a_{12}}} }{{a_{11}+a_{12}+a_{21}+a_{22}}\\choose{a_{11}+a_{12}}}\n\\]\nThis is precisely the probability function for the hypergeometric distribution, used for sampling without replacement and which we use to test the null hypothesis.\n\\[\np(x)=\\frac{{m \\choose x} {n \\choose {k-x}}}{{m+n}\\choose k}\\]\n\n\\(k\\) is the sample size (number of DEGs) = \\(a_{11} + a_{12}\\) = 15\n\\(m\\) is the number of successes in the population (number of BP+ genes) = \\(a_{11} + a_{21}\\) = 12\n\\(n\\) is the number of failures in the population (number of BP- genes) = \\(a_{12} + a_{22}\\) = 20\n\\(x\\) is the number of successes in the sample (number of BP+ among DEGs) = \\(a_{11}\\) = 9\n\\(k-x\\) is the number of failures in the sample (number of BP- among DEGs) = \\(a_{12}\\) = 6\n\\(m+n\\) is the population size (size of gene universe) = \\(a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{21} + a_{22}\\) = 32\n\n\n💡 Basically, we are quantifying the number of ways of obtaining a sample of size \\(k\\) composed of \\(x\\) successes from a total of \\(m\\) successes in the population (\\(m+n\\)) AND the remaining \\(k-x\\) elements as failures from a total of \\(n\\) failures in the population; of all possible ways of randomly selecting \\(k\\) elements from the population.\n\n\nTransferred to our scenario, think of it as having 15 chances to select genes without replacement from the universe that contains both BP+ and BP- genes. Repeat the experiment multiple times and count the times 9 of the 15 genes were BP+ (out of 12 BP+ genes in total) and the remaining 6 genes BP- (out of 20 BP- genes in total), over the number of experiments; that approximates your probability. This probability describes how likely it is to observe your table numbers (9 BP+ and 6 BP- genes in the sample) just by chance.\nLet’s see the density function for the hypergeometric distribution with the above parameters.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## Hypergeometric distribution parameters:\n##  -x = 0:12 (a11 for all possible tables)\n##  -m = 12 \n##  -n = 20\n##  -k = 15\n\nprobabilities &lt;- dhyper(x=c(0:12), m=12, n=20, k=15, log = FALSE)\nxs &lt;- c(0:12)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x=xs, p=probabilities)\ndf \n\n    x            p\n1   0 2.740565e-05\n2   1 8.221696e-04\n3   2 9.043865e-03\n4   3 4.898760e-02\n5   4 1.469628e-01\n6   5 2.586545e-01\n7   6 2.743306e-01\n8   7 1.763554e-01\n9   8 6.782899e-02\n10  9 1.507311e-02\n11 10 1.808773e-03\n12 11 1.027712e-04\n13 12 2.015121e-06\n\n# Bar plot\nggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=p, label=p)) +\n     theme_classic() + \n     geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill= \"beige\", colour=\"black\") +\n     geom_text(label=signif(probabilities, 2), \n                             y=probabilities, size=3, hjust=0.5, vjust=-1) +\n     labs(x = \"Number of BP+ DEGs\", y = \"Probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our actual contingency table \\(p(x=9)=\\frac{{12 \\choose 9} \\times {20\\choose6}}{32\\choose15}\\):\n\n## Calculate manually\nchoose(12,9)*choose(20,6) / choose(32,15)\n\n[1] 0.01507311\n\n# [1] 0.001334633\n\n\nOne-sided test\nAs mentioned before, we are not only interested in the probability of the observed contingency table but also in those for more extreme contingency tables, i.e., tables with greater \\(a_{11}\\)’s.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe add the probabilities of the actual table + the probabilities for such more extreme tables in order to get the probability of having 9 or more DEGs that are BP+ under the null hypothesis:\n\nsum(probabilities[10:13])\n\n[1] 0.01698667\n\n\nSince it is &lt;0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept that there’s an enrichment of BP+ genes amongst our DEGs.\nThis is called a one-sided Fisher’s exact test since we are evaluating probabilities of extreme values at only one side of the density curve (for values equal or greater than \\(a_{11}\\)=9; see plot below).\n\n## Color in red those x&gt;=9\ncolors &lt;- c(rep('beige', 9), rep('red', 4))\ndf$colors &lt;- colors\nggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=p, label=p, fill=colors)) +\n                theme_classic() +\n                geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill= colors, colour=\"black\") +\n                geom_text(label=signif(probabilities, 2),\n                                    y=probabilities, size=3, hjust=0.5, vjust=-1) +\n                labs(x = \"Number of BP+ DEGs\", y = \"Probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe obtain the same result with fisher.test(alternative = ”greater”):\n\nfisher.test(m, alternative = \"greater\") \n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  m\np-value = 0.01699\nalternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is greater than 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.402791      Inf\nsample estimates:\nodds ratio \n  6.529133 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the results of this test are the same for the transposed matrix, so if we put one or the other variable in columns or rows doesn’t affect as long as the first element of the table is the number of successes in the sample (BP+ DEGs). \n\n## Matrix\nm\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    9    6\n[2,]    3   14\n\n## Transposed matrix\nt(m)     \n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    9    3\n[2,]    6   14\n\n## Fisher test on t(m)\nfisher.test(t(m), alternative = \"greater\")  \n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  t(m)\np-value = 0.01699\nalternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is greater than 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.402791      Inf\nsample estimates:\nodds ratio \n  6.529133"
