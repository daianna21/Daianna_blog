Daianna here. I graduated from the undergraduate program of Genomic Sciences 🧬 at the National Autonomous University of Mexico 🇲🇽 [LCG-UNAM](https://www.lcg.unam.mx/#general) in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico in 2024. Currently I work at the [Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-group/) in Cambridge, U.K. analyzing single-cell data from iPSC-derived microglia to unveil the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nDuring the last few years I've been involved in multiple omics projects. At the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD)](https://www.libd.org) I analyzed transcriptomic data to explore brain develpment and function 🧠, and at the [Karolinska Institutet (KI)](https://ki.se/en) I've studied genetic variability in genes influencing drug response and toxicity 💊. Along the way, with my undergrad courses and projects, analyzing and dealing with my own data, and attending courses, conferences, and meetings, I’ve learned about statistical analyses and bioinformatic tools and I wanted to share all this knowledge with the scientific community 👥, particularly with other students like me that may not have the same opportunities or academic background but also want to analyze datasets to answer biologically-relevant questions. \n:::\n\n## **Motivation for this website**\n\n![](images/logo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"190\"}\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: justify\"}\nDoing scientific research, collaborating with my classmates and peers, and assisting in bioinformatics courses I’ve noticed the existence of two common problems while analyzing data:\n\n1.  In these interconnected times, with praiseworthy collaborative efforts such as the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) project we can easily develop, share, and use other people’s code, data, methods, and even complete packages for our own analyses. That represents an incredible opportunity for all of us to leverage, contribute, and improve popular and new-emerging computational tools for the reproducible analysis of biological data, no doubts! However, for students and novice researchers, and people coming from areas other than biostatistics, computational biology, or bioinformatics, some analyses may represent obscure-if not completely unknown–territories. People developing these algorithms often assume they have a specialized audience and tend to trivialize underlying statistical concepts and methods when describing their computational functions and packages, not to mention the poor or even missing documentation and support some of the authors offer (with notable exceptions such as *limma* and *variancePartition*, among others). \n\n2.  Second, nowadays it is incredibly simple to run a complete pipeline with a single function. That’s efficient and increases productivity but it also has diluted the needed understanding behind their use. I have found many people, including myself, deludedly thinking we master an analysis only because we have run software programs without errors and have received outputs. We may dominate the practice but that doesn’t imply nor guarantee we understand the theory. \n\n> It seems to me we are a generation of trained students that know how to run an analysis and obtain results, but don’t understand the analyses themselves; in some occasions, not even the reasons why we execute them.
